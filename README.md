SOFTWARE NAME: CHEM MASTER
Communication:
Two types of users are mainly considered Student & Teacher
Student can enter the software easily and can get all information & can ask questions.
Teachers need to login with their password. they can-

Main portion:
Two portions are available 
1.	Organic
2.	Inorganic

Organic:

1.Here, user will find  the reactions of every reagent according to their demand( input system).
Two types of input system –
                       1.User can select the element for the process of creating that product. 
                      2.User can select which product he wants to produce and which reagents are available to him .For example, If the desired product is “Aldehyde” and the available reagent is “Alcohol”, the system will show him that “Oxidation with Sulphuric Acid” will be the best way to approach.
*Here teachers can add reactions

Inorganic:

This part l consists of 5 parts –
      1.Naming and Symbolizing: User  can input  the name of a compound and get the symbol of it and vice-versa.

*Teachers can add compound’s name & its symbol.

      2.Reactions: There will be different types of reactions with definitions and examples.
For detail information, student can connect the net with the given link.
